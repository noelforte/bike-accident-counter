# 404&hellip;obviously.

Here's a question: what did you _think_ you'd find here? Were you hoping there'd be memes? Skill graphs? Bar charts of data? Well, let me be the first one to tell you that this site doesn't have any of that. You either got here because google sent you, someone linked to this random-ass url from the page you either just were on, or maybe you thought you'd be clever and see if you could snoop around in search of something else.

Honestly? I really have no idea why you thought this site would have any more to it than the front and only page. I mean, it's a goddamn site about counting how many times my ass has fallen off my bike, I'm not quite sure what else you want. If you've ever fallen off your bike, you'll know how much it hurts. It ain't fun. 0/10. Would not recommend.

Anyways since you're here you've got a few choices on what to do next:

1. You could hit the back button and go back to whatever you were doing before this.
2. You could check out [what I actually do from 9-5](https://forte.is/) (Freelance, too. Hit me up ðŸ¤™.)
3. Buy me a beer, a coffee, or send condolences via [my venmo](https://venmo.com/noeltforte) if you feel like it.
4. You could take [this express ticket back to the homepage](/), which again, is the only thing this site does.

Happy trails,

The Management
